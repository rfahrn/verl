# Grounding Dataset Adaptation for VERL Integration

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive guidance for adapting your grounding task datasets to work with VERL (Vision-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning) framework. While RadVLM isn't specifically implemented in the current VERL codebase, the framework's architecture supports vision-language models and can be extended to handle grounding tasks effectively.

## Key Findings

### 1. VERL Architecture Compatibility
- **Vision Processing**: VERL supports vision-language models through `verl.utils.dataset.vision_utils`
- **Reward System**: Flexible reward function framework in `verl.utils.reward_score`
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive metric computation in `verl.utils.metric.utils`
- **Multi-modal Support**: Built-in support for image-text pairs and conversation formats

### 2. Data Format Requirements

Your grounding dataset needs to be adapted to VERL's conversation format:

```python
{
    "id": "sample_001",
    "image": "/path/to/image.jpg",
    "conversations": [
        {
            "from": "human",
            "value": "<image>\nFind the red car in the parking lot"
        },
        {
            "from": "assistant",
            "value": "The red car is located at coordinates [100, 150, 300, 400]"
        }
    ],
    "ground_truth": {
        "bboxes": [
            {
                "bbox": [100, 150, 300, 400],
                "confidence": 1.0,
                "class_name": "car",
                "attributes": ["red"]
            }
        ],
        "image_info": {
            "width": 640,
            "height": 480
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. RadVLM Data Generation Strategy

Since RadVLM isn't directly supported, you should:

1. **Use Existing VLM Models**: Leverage models like Qwen2.5-VL that are already supported
2. **Implement Custom Data Generation**: Create synthetic grounding data using existing vision-language models
3. **Progressive Training**: Start with simple grounding tasks and gradually increase complexity

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Dataset Preparation

1. **Convert Your Dataset**: Use the provided conversion functions to transform your grounding data
2. **Validate Coordinates**: Ensure bounding boxes are in XYXY format
3. **Split Data**: Create train/validation/test splits appropriately

### Step 2: IoU-Based Reward Function

The core reward function is based on Intersection over Union (IoU):

```python
def compute_grounding_reward(prediction, ground_truth, iou_threshold=0.5):
    # Parse predicted boxes from model response
    predicted_boxes = parse_bbox_from_response(prediction)
    ground_truth_boxes = [box["bbox"] for box in ground_truth["bboxes"]]
    
    # Compute IoU for each ground truth box
    rewards = []
    for gt_box in ground_truth_boxes:
        max_iou = max([compute_iou(pred_box, gt_box) for pred_box in predicted_boxes])
        reward = 1.0 if max_iou >= iou_threshold else 2 * max_iou - 1
        rewards.append(reward)
    
    return np.mean(rewards)
```

### Step 3: mAP Evaluation Setup

Implement comprehensive mAP evaluation:

```python
def compute_map(predictions, ground_truths, iou_thresholds=[0.5, 0.75, 0.9]):
    # Compute Average Precision for each IoU threshold
    aps = []
    for iou_thresh in iou_thresholds:
        # Compute precision-recall curve
        # Calculate AP using 11-point interpolation
        ap = compute_ap(recalls, precisions)
        aps.append(ap)
    
    return np.mean(aps)  # mAP
```

### Step 4: Integration with VERL

1. **Add Reward Function**: Register your grounding reward function in `verl/utils/reward_score/__init__.py`
2. **Configure Training**: Set up training configuration with appropriate hyperparameters
3. **Run Training**: Use VERL's PPO trainer with your grounding dataset

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- ✅ Ensure accurate bounding box annotations
- ✅ Validate coordinate formats (XYXY vs XYWH)
- ✅ Include diverse object scales and scenes
- ✅ Balance positive and negative examples

### Reward Function Design
- ✅ Use IoU thresholds appropriate for your task (0.5 for general, 0.75 for precise)
- ✅ Implement progressive reward scaling
- ✅ Add penalties for hallucination (false positives)
- ✅ Consider class-specific rewards for multi-class tasks

### Training Strategy
- ✅ Start with smaller learning rates (1e-5 to 1e-6)
- ✅ Use gradient clipping for stability
- ✅ Implement early stopping based on validation mAP
- ✅ Save regular checkpoints for recovery

### Evaluation
- ✅ Use multiple IoU thresholds for mAP (0.5, 0.55, ..., 0.95)
- ✅ Report class-specific performance
- ✅ Include qualitative evaluation samples
- ✅ Monitor overfitting with validation set

## Performance Optimization

### For Large Datasets
- **Batch Processing**: Process images in batches for efficiency
- **Caching**: Cache processed images and features
- **Distributed Training**: Use VERL's distributed training capabilities

### For Complex Scenes
- **Multi-Scale Training**: Train on images of different scales
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply appropriate augmentations while preserving bounding boxes
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simple scenes and progress to complex ones

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Low IoU Scores
**Solution**: 
- Check coordinate format consistency
- Verify image preprocessing steps
- Adjust IoU thresholds based on task difficulty

### Issue 2: Slow Training
**Solution**:
- Reduce batch size or sequence length
- Use gradient accumulation
- Implement mixed precision training

### Issue 3: Poor Generalization
**Solution**:
- Increase dataset diversity
- Apply appropriate regularization
- Use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

## Example Usage

```bash
# 1. Prepare your grounding dataset
python prepare_grounding_dataset.py \
    --input_path your_dataset.json \
    --output_dir data/grounding/

# 2. Train the model
python train_grounding_model.py \
    --config grounding_config.json \
    --output_dir checkpoints/grounding/

# 3. Evaluate the model
python evaluate_grounding_model.py \
    --model_path checkpoints/grounding/best_model.pt \
    --test_data data/grounding/test.json \
    --output_dir results/
```

## Expected Performance

Based on the reward function and evaluation setup:

- **IoU-based Rewards**: Expect gradual improvement in IoU scores during training
- **mAP Scores**: Target mAP@0.5 > 0.7 for good performance, mAP@0.75 > 0.5 for precise localization
- **Training Time**: Expect 10-20 epochs for convergence depending on dataset size

## Conclusion

While RadVLM isn't directly implemented in VERL, the framework's flexible architecture allows for effective grounding task integration. The key is to:

1. **Properly format your dataset** for VERL's conversation structure
2. **Implement robust IoU-based reward functions** that guide the model toward accurate localization
3. **Set up comprehensive mAP evaluation** to track progress across different IoU thresholds
4. **Follow best practices** for data preparation, training, and evaluation

The provided implementations offer a complete solution for adapting your grounding datasets to work with VERL's reinforcement learning framework, enabling you to leverage the power of vision-language models for precise object localization tasks.
